So first thing each secion that
you need to understand he has used different sizes and media queries you are better of using frs
create your own layout start filling with details worry about background later
for nows lets create a good responsive layout for now stop depending on damian
create the header now

Create now using grid for a normal 100% layout learn over time how better practices 

//Download the google font 
//Delete the extra code make your own animations do not depend on damian
font size dependency and margins and padding is bad enough

//Segregate the code into the correct parts like typography, main layout ,
or header

//use glob to import all the css files


//Font sizes need to be managed for each sized screen 
//Font size if written in vmin and stuff will also affect image sizess
